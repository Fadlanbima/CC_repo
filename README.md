# Project Overview
+ **Selected Theme:** Tourism, Creative, and Digital Economy
+ **Title of the Project:** Get Tour (Find Local Tours and Guide Using AI Based on Tourist Destinations)
+ **Background Information:** Tourism is an activity carried out by a person or group of people with the aim of increasing knowledge or gaining pleasure. Sometimes, someone is confused about which tourist destinations to visit. Moreover, foreign tourists who vacation to other countries will find it very difficult to determine tourist destinations. With this application, it is hoped that it can help tourists, both local tourists and international tourists, to determine which destinations to visit. In addition, this application provides complete information ranging from excellence, beauty of tourist attractions, ranking of places, and hope the proposed application will help someone before starting his tour and making tourist destinations that are not known to many people.
